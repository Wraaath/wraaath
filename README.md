# “I use Linux as my operating system,”
I state proudly to the unkempt, bearded man. <br />
He swivels around in his desk chair with a devilish <br />
gleam in his eyes, ready to beardsplain with extreme precision. <br />
“Actually”, he says with a grin, “Linux is just the kernel. You use <br />
GNU+Linux!’ I don’t miss a beat and reply with a smirk, “I use <br />
Alpine, a distro that doesn’t include the GNU coreutils, or any <br />
other GNU code. It’s Linux, but it’s not GNU+Linux.” <br />
<br />
The smile quickly drops from the man’s face. His body begins <br />
convulsing and he foams at the mouth and drops to the floor with a <br />
sickly thud. As he writhes around he screams “I-IT WAS COMPILED <br />
WITH GCC! THAT MEANS IT’S STILL GNU!” Coolly, I reply “If windows <br />
was compiled with gcc, would that make it GNU?” I interrupt his <br />
response with “-and work is being made on the kernel to make it <br />
more compiler-agnostic. Even you were correct, you won’t be for <br />
long.” <br />
<br />
With a sickly wheeze, the last of the man’s life is ejected from <br />
his body. He lies on the floor, cold and limp. I’ve womansplained <br />
Mr. Stallman to death. <br />
